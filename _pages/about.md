I am a DevOps Engineer at [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/us-en) with a focus on Kubernetes, CI/CD and Infrastructure as Code. I'm responsible for designing/implementing scalable infrastructure and managing cloud-native applications on Kubernetes and VMs. I have experience in building and maintaining CI/CD pipelines, automating infrastructure provisioning, and implementing security best practices in cloud environments.

Before relocating back to Thailand, I worked in Geneva, Switzerland as a DevOps Engineer at [CERN](https://www.home.cern/) in the Compact Muon Solenoid [(CMS) experiment](https://cms.cern/), where I was responsible for the migration of storage element authentication to IAM Token and the development of monitoring probe and alerting systems for Data Centers.

I earned my Bachelor of Engineering (B.Eng.) degree from [Chulalongkorn University](https://www.chula.ac.th/) in 2020, specializing in Information and Communication Engineering. During my studies, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at [Sertis](https://www.sertiscorp.com/), where I focused on developing CI/CD pipelines to train, optimize, convert, and deploy deep learning models to embedded-edge devices. Additionally, developed a connector framework for multiple deep learning inference backends to minimize the inference time of the models.
